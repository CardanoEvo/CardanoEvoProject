# CardanoEvoProject
Cardano Evolution is a frictionless yield and liquidity generation smart contract which rewards holders with reflections in Cardano ($ADA) reflections. 
The transaction taxation funds those reflections, as well as adding liquidity and marketing budgets.
The token has investor protection built into the contract, with wallet hold and transaction limits, as well as an anti-bot function embedded into its code. 
Contract also uses a manually-activated burn function in order to provide deflation as and when appropriate.
